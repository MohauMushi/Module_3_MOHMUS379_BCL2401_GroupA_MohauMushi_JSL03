# Project Overview

In this project, I was presented with two JavaScript code examples, each demonstrating a different programming paradigm: imperative and declarative. My task was to analyse these examples and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style. 

# Presentation Talking Points

Example : [1]

## Imperative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **Step-by-Step Explanation:** Explaining the code logic in the imperative approach.
   - The step of the process in the code.
   - Describing how the code provides explicit instructions for each action.
   - Discussing the use of variables to track the state and progress of the process.

2. **Emphasis on How:** Highlighting how the imperative approach focuses on detailing "how" the task is accomplished.
   - Pointing out the use of loops, conditions, and explicit instructions.
   - Discussing any mutable variables or states that change during execution.


Example : [2]

## Declarative Approach [2 Minutes]
1. **High-Level Process Description:** Explain the code logic in the declarative approach.
   - Describing the cooking process in a high-level, abstract manner.
   - Emphasizing that the code defines "what" should happen rather than "how" it should happen.

2. **Use of Data Structures:** Discussing the use of data structures (e.g., arrays, objects) to represent the process steps.
   - Explaining how the process steps are organized in a structured format.
   - Mentioning any abstraction layers or functions used to encapsulate actions.

# Learning Outcome [1 Minute]
- Reflecting on what i've learned from analyzing these code examples in different paradigms.
